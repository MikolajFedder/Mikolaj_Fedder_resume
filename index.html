        • Professional Summary
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am currently studying software engineering at the internationally credited University of Edinburgh SE boot camp, through which I am learning the basic and advanced understanding of languages such as Python, Java, HTML and CSS.
        I always strive to commence all learning opportunities that further enhance my skills within this field and understand the importance of subsisting on a point of issue. 
        My goal is to acquire an entry-level role as a software engineer and take on this career path seriously. 
        To make this first initial step in my 'beginnings' as a SE I use my time wisely to further enhance my coding skills by developing some of the vital attributes which a successful SE needs in this day and age 
        i.e. researching, verbal and written communications, problem- solving, developing a fundamental understanding of new trends within the tech industry, and of course coding.

        Construction Site Labourer, 09/2019 – Current 
        LionBrickwood LTD 
    </h3>
    <p>
        LionBrickwood LTD is a successful construction firm that both my mother and father have built. 
        As of September 2019, I have been supervising my father's work and have been acquainted with what would be expected of me beforehand. 
        Although the task and skills which I was going to learn sounded like hard work, nonetheless I was driven by the thought that I will be helping out my family's business.
        Since working here I have learnt/observed a multitude of diverse skills in this trade, and have been recently given the chance to run certain construction projects by myself, alongside a great team of labourers. 
        There have been days that have been extremely challenging and painful, however, despite these days which sometimes were dreaded they have most certainly crafted a high level of discipline and independence which I have learnt over my last couple of years as an adult help immensely.

        Goalkeeper Coach, 09/2019 – 11/2019
        Cardinal Newman Catholic School
    </h3>
    <p>
        During my studies at Cardinal Newman College, I had the fabulous opportunity of coaching goalkeeping sessions to 18 and 19-year-olds. 
        This specific responsibility felt 'natural' to me since I have previously played at a top level of goalkeeping for a team in Sussex called ‘Hove Park Colts FC', this career lasted 10 years. 
        During the coaching, I learnt how to observe other people's skills and analyze what help I can provide them to improve a skill in which they are currently weak. 
        Furthermore, I have learnt that there are quick learners and slow learners. Understanding this had helped me develop personal skills of the best ways to help someone improve in a certain field based on their adeptness to learn. 
        For example, one of my students who had an invitation to a Brighton Academy trial mentioned that he had problems staying on his feet which cause him to have poor balance. 
        After listening to him I began to look at the potential issues/causes which led to him being ‘off-balance' or ‘staying on his feet. Soon I realized that this player would always rush into his actions heavily. 
        What this means in football ‘terms' is that the player did not stay ‘light' and did not observe. Immediately after coming to this finalised conclusion I spoke to this student and decided to create a ‘fitness' program which focused on this weakness, and after a few weeks of dedication from the sportsman he overcame this issue and you wouldn't believe it, 
        but eventually followed through with the invitation and had the opportunity to train alongside some world-class academy players.

        Customer Service Assistant Supervisor, 01/2019 – 09/2019 
        Harley Davidson
    </h3>
    <p>
        At Harley Davidson, the main role was to provide great customer interactions and help create new 'ones'. 
        My main focus during my work stay at Harley Davidson was to establish that customers who came, always had welcoming service to which they can discuss any enquiries/issues they had. 
        As well as providing warming gestures i.e. offering them a cup of coffee or tea, asking how their day was, showcasing new products in-store and overall sustaining a great relationship with the customer. 
        Additional duties/tasks which were required of me were maintaining the visual appearance of in-store and outdoor retailed bikes every morning before the store opened, washing cars, taking the trash out, mowing the grass, and occasionally serving food and drink from the food - stand. 
        Overall I enjoyed my work time at Harley-Davidson. It gave me the opportunity to build great customer service skills, via learning the issue the customer may have and why they have, and later providing the best advice that a Harley Davidson employee would.
